            <h2>Avni Rastogi</h2>
            <p>Hello! I’m Avni Rastogi, a sophomore at JIIT Noida, with a deep passion for web development. My journey in technology is fueled by curiosity, and I'm constantly exploring new tools and frameworks to expand my skill set.</p>
            <p>I’m a proud bibliophile, and I believe that every book opens up a new world of ideas and perspectives. When I’m not reading, you’ll find me with my camera, capturing the beauty of nature through travel and photography. I enjoy discovering new cuisines and the stories behind them, as food has a way of bringing people together.</p>
            <p>Art is another significant part of my life; I love to sketch, which allows me to express my creativity. Lately, I’ve developed a growing interest in data science, and I find myself learning something new every day.</p>
            <p>Originally from Delhi, I completed my schooling at GD Goenka Karkardooma. I pride myself on being determined and dedicated, though I occasionally battle with procrastination. Embracing both my strengths and weaknesses, I strive to grow and evolve continuously.</p>
